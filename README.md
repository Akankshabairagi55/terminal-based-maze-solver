This Python script implements a maze solver game using BFS algorithm. It generates a maze of a specified size with a start (S) and end (E) point. Players can choose to find the path through the maze, generate a new maze, or exit the game. The solution path is marked with '◍'. The code incorporates colored output for a visually appealing interface. 🎮🧩🌟
